# Testini web CTF challenge
This is the repository of the web CTF challenge I created for the Testini event held last december .

## Scenario

During a recent team project, each of us had a personal account created to test the web application connected to a database. Everything seemed normal at first, but we soon realized that one of our team members had hidden something within the application—something they clearly didn’t want the rest of us to find.

## Your Mission

1. Identify the team member who is hiding the secret.
2. Retrieve the secret they are concealing.

## Flag Format

The flag should be in the following format:

testini{<member_name>_<hidden_seceret>}
